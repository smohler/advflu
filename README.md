  This is a `manim` animation of 'Advanced Fluid Dynamics' initially taught at [**Portland State University**](https://www.pdx.edu/) taught by Samuel Mohler. 
The project is a conception of making fluid dynamics more readily available to the youtuber and googler. 
Currently the YouTube community is lacking in intuitive education of fluid dynamics and the solutions which arise from *solving* special examples of the [Navier Stokes Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations).
I believe that the animations and tools we have to make lectures better scene thru video are under utilized which is why I decided to take on this endevour and also make it open source.
If there are any other instructors that would like to contribute `manim` scenes to this project I highly encourage it.
